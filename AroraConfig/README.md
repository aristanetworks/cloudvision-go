# ardc-config/AroraConfig
Hosts nightly run Ansible playbooks as well as playbooks used to convert AroraConfig packages out of Arora.

## How to Write Playbooks
Reference playbooks in this repo as well as Ansible's [documentation](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_intro.html) for examples. When in doubt, ask ansible-infra@.
