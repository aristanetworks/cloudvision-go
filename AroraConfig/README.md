# ardc-config
This repository is used to host playbooks, config files (e.g. hosts file like 'ansible\_hosts'), and test framework that is expected to be used by Ansible for datacenter server provisioning and maintenance.

## How to Write Playbooks
Description of what a playbook is and how to write them are available in Ansible's own [documentation](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_intro.html).
