# Dworker support in ASB is being done in stages.
# Currently Dworker role is setup mostly in PXE kickstart
# and so minimal ASB stages are used. Gradually, the
# PXE kickstart based procedure will be broken down into
# ASB pipeline stages.
#
# Current stages in Dworker ASB pipeline:
#
# REIMAGE-HEALTHCHECK: advances to DISK if healthchecks pass
#   we don't follow rest of the reimage pipeline since kickstart based
#   install wipes and re initializes the partitions.
# DISK: performs the PXE kickstart based install, advances to CLEANUP stage
# CLEANUP: checks install state and advances to HELP_ME or INSTALLED stage
#
dworker_stages:
   reimage_healthcheck: milkyway
   core: milkyway
   cleanup: milkyway
