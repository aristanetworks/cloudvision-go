To install, do the following on ticketserver:
1. issueTicket - this is the cron job. Place under ticketserver:/etc/cron.d
2. restore_server - this is Thomas' script.
3. restore_server_wrapper - this is the wrapper for Thomas' script. This must be
   checked out from ASB repo and placed somewhere. Place symlink for this wrapper
   under /root/. It's better to place restore_server script in the same directory as
   restore_server_wrapper script
