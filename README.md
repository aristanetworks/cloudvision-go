# cloudvision-go
This repository contains Go resources and libraries for integrating with Arista's CloudVision platform. Right now it provides two major categories of functionality:

- Go bindings for Resource APIs, which allow external systems to integrate with CloudVision
- The CloudVision Device SDK, which provides a framework for streaming data from third-party network devices into CloudVision
