# This role will install kubernetes on the specified hosts
# When this role is applied to a host group, it will
# look for some vars for each host and install the different k8s components based on those vars
# Here is the list of all the host variables that MUST be defined in order for this role
# to work correctly:
#   - K8S_MASTER - boolean - hostvar: Will flag this host as a k8s master server
#   - K8S_WORKER - boolean - hostvar: Will flag this host as a k8s worker server
