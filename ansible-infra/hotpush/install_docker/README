Installation scripts for docker and correct mounting of data directory for docker.

Data directory for docker should always be mounted to the largest partition on the host i.e. for user servers /persist, for build servers /persist2. These changes were necessary because docker RPM hardcodes the mountpoint to /persist and thus is not relevant for any other servers than user servers.
